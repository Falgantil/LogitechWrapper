Where to start
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a demo program to change lighting on devices:

Execute Demo/LCDDemo.exe.

Or:

1. Go to Samples/LCDDemo folder and open the project in
   Visual Studio (LCDDemo.sln for VS2010).

2. Compile and run.

3. Plug in one or multiple compatible devices at any time.


To implement game controller support in your game:

1. Include the following header file in your game:

- Include/LogitechLcd.h

2. Include the following library and dll in your game:

- Lib\x86\LogitechLed.lib and Lib\x86\LogitechLcd.dll or
- Lib\x64\LogitechLed.lib and Lib\x64\LogitechLcd.dll

3. Alternatively you may only add the LogitechLcd.dll to your game and use
   GetProcAddress to access its functions.

4. Read and follow instructions from Doc/LogitechGamingLCDSDK.pdf
